## 📖 About the Project

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden recurrent seizures. Early detection and timely alerts can **save lives**.  
This project aims to:

- Detect epileptic seizures using **EEG data** and machine learning models.  
- Provide **real-time notifications** to caregivers.  
- Enable easy monitoring and visualization of seizure patterns.

⚡ **Goal:** A lightweight, affordable, and accessible system for seizure detection and alerts.

---

## 🌟 Features

## 🏗 System Architecture

```
EEG Data → Preprocessing → ML/DL Model → Detection → Alert System → Dashboard
```

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohantiwari10/Epilepcy-Detection-And-Alert-System.git
   cd Epilepcy-Detection-And-Alert-System
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment** *(recommended)*:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🧪 Usage

1. Run the detection system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Upload EEG data or start real-time monitoring.  
3. View results on the dashboard or console.  
4. If a seizure is detected, **alerts will be triggered automatically**.

---

## 🧠 Dataset

- Publicly available EEG seizure datasets such as:
  - University of Bonn EEG dataset  
  - CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database
- Data is preprocessed and segmented before training.  
- You can use your own dataset by placing it in the `data/` folder and updating the preprocessing script.

---

## 🧮 Model Training

To retrain or fine-tune the model:
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
```

You can customize hyperparameters inside `config.py`.

---

## 🚨 Alert System

- Alert system uses a webhook / API / SMS gateway (e.g., Twilio).  
- When a seizure is detected:
  - 📲 Emergency SMS is sent
  - 🖥️ Dashboard updates in real-time
  - 🩺 Logs are stored for medical review
